You can make any number of goals you want, and for all the metrics you have. Peak includes two styles of goals:\n- Show up goals, where you set daily goals and how often you’d like to accomplish them, be it daily, or at least a certain of days every week or month. These are great for building new habits in a sustainable manner by setting a target of say 5 days a week rather than daily.\n- Build goals, where you set an overall, long term goal for a whole week, month or year. These are recommended for anyone who doesn’t need to build a new habit but is looking to maintain one. Their less strict definition helps you create more flexible targets that you can distribute as you see fit.\n\n→ Workout-Specific Stats\nYou can limit blocks to any workout types you want. This means that you can set a goal to go for a swim twice a week, track trends in your runs, see charts of your strength training, and much more!\n\n→ Widgets & Complications\nPeak includes a wide variety of beautifully designed widgets and complications to help you keep track of your progress at a glance. These let you keep track of your stats for today, your progress towards your goals, and more. Each widget can also be customized with its own themes, for both light and dark mode.\n\n→ Recaps\nGet a summary of your progress over the past day, week, month, and year! You can also quickly share your recaps on social media with beautifully designed images\n\n→ An Assortment of Themes\nPeak includes over 80 beautifully designed themes, so you can find the exact appearance for your tastes. You can even set different custom themes for light and dark mode.\n\n→ Private By Design\nPrivacy is one of the Peak’s core values. Health data is some of the most sensitive data people have, so there is no tracking or data collection.\n\n→ A Delight to Use\nPeak feels right at home on your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro, and includes familiar patterns and a lot of small touches to make using the app a breeze. You can customize the whole app to fit your style including the app icon, themes, units, and more.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"
