# Peak Localisations

This repository contains all the localisation string files for Peak, a fitness dashboard and widgets app for iOS and iPadOS. You can [download Peak from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peak/id6443923491)

If you speak another language, and would like to help translate Peak to support it, we'd love your help!

Please open an issue if you have a question about translating the app. I'm more than happy to clarify any terms that are ambiguous or confusing.
